/*
File contains a sample usage of the tic tac toe verifier. You can run it to see how the verifier works, and modify it to test different boards.
Commented out since the test file already contains comprehensive tests.

The "main app" file (current) becomes useful if you want to take board from a user input, and then verify its state. You can also use it to run some quick manual tests without having to write a full test case in the test file.
Of course, in the case of user input via console, you would need to add code to convert it into the expected format for the `ticTacToeVerifier` function!

// import type {CellValue} from "./domain";

//     ["O", "X", "X"],
// ] as CellValue[][];

// const gameState = ticTacToeVerifier(board);
// console.log(prettyPrintGameReport(gameState));
